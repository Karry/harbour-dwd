# harbour-dwd
A german weather service app for  SailfishOS. 
The service at brightsky.dev creates an easy to use json api to get at the data. I wrap that with QML.

https://brightsky.dev/demo for a web demo and https://github.com/jdemaeyer/brightsky/ for the source.

Translations are being trialled with the Weblate service at https://hosted.weblate.org

Just getting it up-to-date for SFOS 3.4. This is a simple project to test QML programming and network api usage/access.
