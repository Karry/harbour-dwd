# harbour-HackerNews
Hacker News app for SailfishOS. 
The original Repo served as a kitb to get me thinking about working with apis in QML. 

harbour-hafenschau a German language project went even furhter.
https://github.com/black-sheep-dev/harbour-hafenschau  It's great programming. 

I'm hoping to emulate some of that with this project. In a small way :)

Just getting it up-to-date for SFOS 3.4. This is a simple project to test QML programming and network api usage/access.
